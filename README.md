# k-Means Clustering Algorithm in C and Python

This repository contains two implementations of the k-means clustering algorithm, one in C and one in Python. k-means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that partitions a dataset into k clusters, where each point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean. The algorithm iteratively updates the means of each cluster until convergence.
# C Implementation

The C implementation of k-means is written in ANSI C90 and can be compiled on any platform using a C compiler. It takes a CSV file as input and outputs the final cluster centroids to the console. The program uses the Lloyd's algorithm for k-means clustering and has been optimized for performance using parallel processing and dynamic memory allocation.
# Python Implementation

The Python implementation of k-means is written in Python3. It takes a CSV file as input and outputs the final cluster centroids and assignments to a CSV file. The program uses the Lloyd's algorithm for k-means clustering and has been optimized for readability and ease of use.

Both implementations have been thoroughly tested and validated against standard datasets, such as the Iris dataset and the Wine dataset. 

Please feel free to use, modify, and distribute the code according to your needs. Any feedback or suggestions are greatly appreciated!
